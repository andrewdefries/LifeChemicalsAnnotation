# LifeChemicalsAnnotation
Annotation of the Life Chemical stock compound library using several cheminformatic and full text mining approaches

This repository contains code and documentation to subset the Life Chemicals Stock compounds (http://www.lifechemicals.com/downloads/9353/9360) into custom collections.

Motivation
==========

Life Chemicals has a large collection of ~380,000 diverse small molecule compounds. The entire compound library may be interrogated one-by-one by experimentation. This would require purchasing the whole stock, which is not a frugal option. Therefore, I have pre-assembled a number of custom collections for specific chemical genetics research subtypes. In addition, the user may assemble a custom collection based on custom filters on this R Shiny web application.
